This is my first mini project in the certificate course for Data Science & AI from the Institute of Data, Singapore. In this project, I have created a Jupyter notebook to do exploratory data analysis on a customer churn data set from Kaggle. I have added few records and also updated the country details to be inconsistent (used ISO code for some entries and full country name in some entries) so as to create duplicates & data capture inconsistencies so that I can handle it as part of the EDA techniques that I learned.
